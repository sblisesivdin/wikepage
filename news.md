## New developers and wikepage's future
*Tue, 07 Oct 2008 - 20:19:40 CEST*

I am happy to announce that Wikepage has a new developer. Jose N. Medeiros will be the new lead programmer of the project. Welcome Jose. Of course, with a two active developers, we have some plans for the future of wikepage. Firstly, we plan the release the 2008.1 as soon as possible. This release will be the last classic Wikepage. It will have YouTube support and some bugfixes. As you know, wikepage is a small single-file php script. After 2008.1, new wikepage will be completely rewritten. It planned to be a plugin supported microcode. SQLite and MySQL support, simple user authorization, a new administration, wikipedia type wiki-syntax and some other features are planned to be included in the new Wikepage. We will change the roadmap section at the Development page with including TODOs. Please visit us later for more information about the roadmap and new features of the future wikepage. And lastly.. with a microcode style index.php, previous prime directive* can not be logical any more. New wikepage will have its own new prime directive :) *:"index.php and zipped version of wikepage can not exceed a file size of 38911 bytes." Thanks for your interest, S. B. Lisesivdin

## Developers wanted.
*Sun, 15 Jun 2008 - 20:39:21 CEST*

For a while, I am so busy and I can't pay attention to wike. And I think from now on I will not. Personally, wikepage was like a home for me. It was my last connection to my old formation "Cyrocom". For a 30Kb script, it worked well! A homepage, a work page, a blog... In every scenario, I used it. With over 17000 downloads, it is used in many sites. In Fig.1, download number versus date is shown.

## Opus 12, 2007.1 released! ... Modules? what is that?
*Tue, 13 Feb 2007 - 0:52:20 CEST*

Ok..I accept. Late releases are traditional. But I know you like Opus 12. I already make a site with Opus 12, take a look: http://www.threefives.org outlink. New features/fixes of 2007.1 (codename: Aharonov - Bohm) are:

* Heading problem in IE browsers is fixed,
* RSS import feature is added (One feed per page for now).

And, I want to introduce something new from Tim Davis: I have written and tested a small app to modify Wikepages' index.php file based on a set of instructions you give it. The command line app is working and I'm currently writing a Windows based app to preform the same task. Once that is complete I'm going to recompile the command line app with Mono so it will be cross platform (Windows/OS X/Linux), and then I'll put the files up for testing. It is so simple and effective. Module is a kind of function addition to system which has a simple text commands like FIND, ADD, REPLACE. Modules modify the main index.php, so it makes your own wikepage. You can share your modules with the community or find new ones for your own project. Please visit the homepage of the Wikepage Modder at http://www.binarymethod.com/ outlink for more information. Thanks Tim. And I add up some information to Development page. Simply, Wikepage needs your help. Wikepage needs new developers, new theme writers, document writers ...etc... If you want to be a developer, then write an email to Sefer Bora Lisesivdin (sblisesivdin-AT-gmail.com) and introduce yourself. Our development will have only one rule. We will call it "prime directive": index.php and zipped version of wikepage can not exceed a file size of 38911 bytes. Thanks, Enjoy.

## Info for downloaders of 2006.3 before October 30th
*Mon, 30 Oct 2006 - 11:51:30 CEST*
